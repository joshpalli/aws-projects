# AWS Projects
I began my cloud computing journey in March 2023, and through this journey, I have acquired success in gaining my AWS Cloud Practitioner and AWS Solutions Architect - Associate certifications. At the time of creating this repository, I have implemented 25+ different solutions on AWS in a wide range of integrations such as web applications, containers, databases, devops, analytics, networking, storage, data engineering, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

I have recently been thinking about documenting my projects in a more formal way, so I decided to migrate my projects to GitHub. Here, you can see the work I have done in my personal cloud developement journey. The documentation for my projects is currently in progress, so please keep that in mind while checking out my projects.
