# Part 3.1: Athena SQL Queries
## Description
In this module, I performed analytical queries on the data lake I created. I created these queries on my own, and deployed them for results to retrieve the results.

## File Guide
1. Query1-SalesByDepartment.sql - A .sql file containing a SQL query to return the sales of each department
2. Query1Results.png - An image showing the results of the query in the Amazon Athena console.
3. Query2-Top10BestSellingProducts.sql - A .sql file containing SQL code that returns the top 10 best selling products.
4. Query2Results.png - An image showing the results of query 2 that returns the top 10 best selling products based on sales.
