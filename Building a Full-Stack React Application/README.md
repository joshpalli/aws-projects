# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This project involved creating a simple React note maker application that recorded different text notes that the user puts in. The application implemented an authentication layer, allowing users to create an account to access their own personal notes. The application also added functionality to upload images to the notes app. Proof of concepts are found in the repository.

## AWS Services Used
* AWS Amplify
* Amazon DynamoDB
* AWS AppSync for GraphQL API Implementation

## Additional Technologies Used
* Git
* Node.js v.10
* Sublime Text
* Terminal

## Challenges 
* Had to restart project due to problems with Git commands and code change mistakes
* Troubleshooted Git commands by switching to superuser access, using sudo behind every command.
* Fixed code change mistakes by utilizing Subime Text as a text editor
* Fixed project issues through research, knowledge of how Git push works, and knowledge of terminal superuser permissions

## Procedure
Full procedure can be found at [Build Full Stack React Application](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-react-app-amplify-graphql/?ref=gsrchandson&id=updated).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
